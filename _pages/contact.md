### Prospective students

I am accepting motivated Ph.D. students who are interested in research in the area of Information Retrieval / Natural Language Processing / Text Mining & Analysis. If you want to get a sense of the kind of problems students who work with me work on, check out [Information Retrieval Lab](http://ir.cs.georgetown.edu).
